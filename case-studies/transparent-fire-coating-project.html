<h2>Beijing 2024 National Stadium Equestrian Event</h2>

<p>
During the 2024 major equestrian competition hosted at the iconic National Stadium in Beijing,
our <strong>transparent intumescent fire protection coating</strong> was selected for key structural wood and steel elements.
</p>

<h3>Project Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maintain original architectural appearance</li>
<li>Provide certified fire resistance performance</li>
<li>Low odor & environmentally friendly</li>
<li>Fast curing for event schedule deadline</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution Provided</h3>
<p>
Our water-based transparent intumescent coating delivered up to 60-minute fire resistance 
while preserving the natural material texture. The ultra-clear finish ensured that 
architectural aesthetics were fully retained.

<h2>Macao 2025 – 25th Anniversary Landmark Project</h2>

<p>
In celebration of the 25th Anniversary of Macao's return, our environmentally friendly 
transparent fire-retardant coating was selected again for a high-visibility landmark structure.
</p>

<h3>Why Selected Again?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zero strong odor during application</li>
<li>Crystal-clear transparent finish</li>
<li>Certified fire rating performance</li>
<li>Compliance with green building standards</li>
</ul>

<p>
The project required both high fire safety standards and architectural transparency.
Our advanced intumescent formulation expanded under heat exposure,
forming an insulating char layer while remaining invisible under normal conditions.
